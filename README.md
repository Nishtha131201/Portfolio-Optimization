# Portfolio-Optimization Conclusion

**For the training period**                       
Expected annual return : 8.0% 

Annual volatility / risk: 17.0% 

Annual variance: 3.0%

**For the testing period after optimization** 
Expected annual return : 42.0% 

Annual volatility / risk: 24.0% 

Annual variance: 6.0%

# **How did you choose the stocks?** 

The five stocks that I choose are all from IT sector, So I wanted to make a portfolio on the IT sector of NSE.

# **What is the impact of increasing the number of stocks in the portfolio?** 

The more stocks you hold in your portfolio, the lesser is the risk that you are carrying. As they say there is safety in numbers. Chances of any one company going out of business and stock value going to near zero value is always there, but larger the number of stocks you carry in your portfolio, the impact of such accidents on your overall returns gets minimised. 

Impact of any high-return stock or stocks on the overall portfolio performance keeps going down as the number of stocks go higher. So, the higher the return expectations, the lower should be the diversification. 

But, risk of loosing money keeps getting higher as the concentration in the portfolio keeps increasing

# **Why are calculating the weights by optimization and not giving equal weightage to every stock?** 

To understand this, let us take an example:

As the investment weight varies, the returns also varies. For example, if I had decided to invest just 40 percent in Infosys and 60 percent in Biocon, I’d have enjoyed a return of 17.8 percent.

However, if I had reversed it by investing 60 percent in Infosys and 40 percent in Biocon, I’d have enjoyed a return of 19.2 percent, which is an additional 2 percent return.

This leads us to a super important conclusion - as the investment weights vary, the returns vary. In fact, each return has an associated risk profile, so it is prudent to state – as the weights vary, both the risk and return characteristics vary.

This is exactly what happens when you optimize your portfolio. Generally speaking, you can adjust the weights (or optimize your portfolio) such that, for the given set of stocks –

1) You identify the investment weights to achieve the best possible return or 
2) You identify the investment weights to achieve the least possible risk

# **Which optimization techniques are used by Mutual Funds currently?** 

Similar to modern portfolio theory, investments in risk-free assets are represented by Treasury bills. Farther up the capital market line an investor can include greater amounts of higher risk assets such as emerging market equity mutual funds. At the lower end of the spectrum, an investor may invest in short-term, high-quality-debt mutual funds.

Overall, the mutual fund theorem suggests that investors can build an optimal portfolio using mutual funds. This type of portfolio can increase diversification. It may also have other advantages, such as operational trading efficiencies.


# **Which parameters are you using to check the accuracy of your model?** 

The parameters used in my model to check the accuracy is the Efficient Frontier model and the covariance matrix and volatility.
